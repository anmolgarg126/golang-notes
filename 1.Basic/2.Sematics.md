There are 2 types of semantics in golang:
   1. Value Semantics
   2. Pointer Semantics

### Value semantics

It means every piece of code is operating on its own copy of the data. As we make transitions across program boundaries, in-between functions, as we do things, we are operating on our own copy of data.
#### Advantages:
- isolation
- immutability(mutation is isolated)
- Prevents side effects due to unexpected memory changes
- Prevents Garbage collection, as stack memory is taken care of with GC involvement

#### Disadvantages:
- Have to copy data over and over
- If the data size exceeds stack frame, new stack frame is allocated and data is copied over. It may introduce some runtime latencies


### Pointer semantics

It means we are sharing the data across program boundaries, in-between functions, as we do things, we are operating on the same original data.
#### Advantages:
- Efficiencies

#### Disadvantages:
- GC comes into play as mainly this data is kept on heap.
- Mutation has to be dealt with caution to prevent side effects either through synchronisation, orchestration.
